# Freelance Project

##### A freelance design development process, September 14-21, 2018

#### By AJ MCgladdery

## Project Description

This project showcases a new co-working startup. The site’s design reflects the physical environment’s unique feel: balancing a luxurious, cool, and high-end feel with a welcoming inclusivity. The site demonstrates the workspace’s commitment to safety, comfort, and productivity. The site also showcases the startup’s funky and local charm, which is different from more sterile, corporate co-working competitors. Another distinction of this startup is its broader clientele, which transcends the tech-world and includes artists, daytraders, craftspeople, writers, counselors, more traditional business people. The site features the start-up’s wide range of amenities. The site includes a landing page, contact page, page featuring amenities, page detailing subscription model/cost/membership/how to join.

## Description of Responsiveness

Project designed to accommodate mobile, tablet, and desktop. Mobile version will have carousels of several photos, while tablet and desktop will display several photos at a time. Otherwise, mobile will stack vertically while the large viewports will populate rows as much as possible.

## Developmental Roadmap

Going forward, this project needs more content (text and photos) to populate the desktop and tablet versions. It also needs a more suiting font. Symbols need to be created for the repeated portions of the wireframe. After testing prototypes, the project will then need to be coded.
